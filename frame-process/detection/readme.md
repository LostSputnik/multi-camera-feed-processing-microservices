```detect.py``` is a simple object detection script using YOLOv4 and OpenCV. 

To obtain the YOLOv4 model files, including the weights (`yolov4.weights`), configuration file (`yolov4.cfg`), and the class names file (`coco.names`), you generally need to download them from the official sources or repositories that host these files. The YOLOv4 model is developed by Alexey Bochkovskiy, and the official GitHub repository provides links to download these files. 

I have included the configuration file (`yolov4.cfg`), and the class names file (`coco.names`) but you need to download the weights (`yolov4.weights`) as its rather large. [link to yolov4.weights](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4.weights)


### Notes:
- Make sure that the versions of the `.cfg` and `.weights` files match (i.e., both are for YOLOv4). Mismatched versions can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
